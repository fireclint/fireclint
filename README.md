- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Clint Briley and I am a Cloud Engineer who codes.
- ðŸ‘€ Coding & Web Development is a passion of mine especially within e-commerce. I run an online e-commerce business and I enjoy being able to code on it myself!
- ðŸŒ± I am always studying and trying to learn new technologies! I started with the basics of HTML & CSS.  I soon progressed to JavaScript. I have built projects 
in React, JavaScript, PHP and of course basic HTML/CSS. I am currently expanding my React JS knowledge and enjoying building cool API projects!
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at firebriley@yahoo.com
